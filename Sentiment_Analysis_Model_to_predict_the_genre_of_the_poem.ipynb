Approximately 44.68% of the events that were predicted as positive were really true positives in this scenario. This metric denotes the number of chosen things that are pertinent.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Recall (0.4524): Recall, or sensitivity, quantifies the model's capacity to correctly detect all the true positive instances. The model accurately detected around 45.24% of the total true positives. It represents the accuracy of properly predicting the actual positive cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "* F1-score (0.4432): The F1-score represents the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It offers a unified score that takes into account both precision and recall. A higher F1-score signifies superior overall performance in relation to both false positives and false negatives. The F1-score in this instance is approximately 44.32%.\n",
